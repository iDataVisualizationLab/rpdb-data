This report focuses on aggregates used in the construction of continuously reinforced concrete
pavements (CRCP). Specific chapters address (1) past research regarding aggregates used in asphalt
concrete paving, (2) field and laboratory investigations of asphalt concrete pavements, and (3) CRCP
behavior and distress. Also addressed are research activities related to aggregates used in asphalt cement
concrete pavements. The report reviews such topics as spalling and punchout distresses in continuously
reinforced and jointed pavements, aggregate shape characterization using fractals, and the determination
of sawcut depth using fractal analysis. Some of these activities relate directly to improving pavement
performance, regardless of aggregate type used for construction. Early recommendations based on the
project's significant findings have already been presented to the Texas Department of Transportation.
